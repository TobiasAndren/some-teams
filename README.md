# some-teams

This project is a website which includes some football teams from different women's leagues and some information about where the teams are located, what group they are part of and also their UEFA coefficent ranking and a link to the organizations website. It also includes an about me page with some information about the author (me). I created this project using PHP, HTML and CSS.
